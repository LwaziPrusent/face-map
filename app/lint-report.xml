        category="Performance"
        priority="4"
        summary="Handler reference leaks"
        explanation="Since this Handler is declared as an inner class, it may prevent the outer class from being garbage collected. If the Handler is using a Looper or MessageQueue for a thread other than the main thread, then there is no issue. If the Handler is using the Looper or MessageQueue of the main thread, you need to fix your Handler declaration, as follows: Declare the Handler as a static class; In the outer class, instantiate a WeakReference to the outer class and pass this object to your Handler when you instantiate the Handler; Make all references to members of the outer class using the WeakReference object."

Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"

        category="Bi-directional Text"
        priority="5"
        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.
For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.
(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"
